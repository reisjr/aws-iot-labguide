## Clone the Repository

You need to create a few resources which will be used during the workshop. To create them, you will use CDK, an easy way to provision resources on your account. 
Follow the instructions below to complete the set up.

* Go to the Cloud9 terminal
* Clone the workshop github repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reisjr/aws-iot-playground.git
```

## Deploy the Container for Virtual Devices
---
* Go to the root directory of the repository
```bash
cd ~/environment/aws-iot-playground
```
* Install jq
```bash
$ sudo yum install -y jq
```
* Push the sample code to the pipeline ** WARNING: the push command requires the resources specified in the CDK step to be already created!
```bash
$ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=<region-you-chose>
$ ./scripts/push.sh
```
