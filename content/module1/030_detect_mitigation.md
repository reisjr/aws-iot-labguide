Your first security mitigation solution helped the company to solve the most pressing issues in a short time span. Now, you want to evaluate if any device starts to behave anomalously. This may indicate different problems that require immediate attention, for example, a new bug or a compromised credendital. In this part, you will learn how to use AWS IoT Device Defender to simplify this task. The sample architecture shows an example of how to setup AWS IoT Device Defender Detect to monitor your devices' behavior and quarantine them if required.

You will walk through a solution which has the following tasks:

* Configure AWS IoT Device Defender Detect
* Setup a SNS Topic to send Alerts to an AWS Lambda Function
* Understand and update the AWS Lambda function to process the audit results and fix detected issues
* Start a rogue device
* Validate the mitigation action

The diagram below depicts the AWS services used in this solution and the main steps executed after completing the setup.

## Understanding AWS IoT Device Defender Detect

A *Behavior* tells AWS IoT Device Defender Detect how to recognize when a device is doing something abnormal. Each behavior consists of a name, a metric, an operator, a value, and, in some cases, a time period (duration). Any device action that **DOES NOT** match a defined behavior statement triggers an alert.

A *Security Profile* defines anomalous behaviors for a group of devices (a thing group) or for all devices in your account, and specifies what actions to take when an anomaly is detected.  AWS IoT Device Defender Detect starts recording security-related data and uses the behaviors defined in the security profile to detect anomalies in the behavior of the devices.

To create a **Security Profile**, follow the steps below:

* Open the AWS IoT console
* In the left navigation pane, choose **Defend**
* In the left navigation pane, choose **Detect**
* Choose **Create your first security profile**
![CreateSecProf](/images/30_ddd_create_secprof_01.png)

In this section, you will specify one behavior that you want to monitor. It will check if there are any failures on the authentication of the fleet. In a normal situation, you may have a few failures due to connectivity, but more than that may indicate a security issue, so you will create an alarm.

* For **Name**, type a value to identify this profile. For example, `MsgSentSecProfile`
* Scroll to the **Behaviors** section
* Fill the **Name** field for the first *Behavior*. Example: `MsgSentBehavior`
* On the **Metric** field, choose **Messages sent**
* On the **Operator** field, choose **Less than**
* On the **Value** field, type **5**
* On the **Duration** field, choose **5 minutes**
* Scroll down to finish the setup
![CreateSecProf](/images/30_ddd_create_secprof_02.png)
* Click **Next** on the bottom right
![CreateSecProf](/images/30_ddd_create_secprof_03.png)

Now, you will need to configure an SNS topic to receive the *Alerts* and a Role allowing AWS IoT Device Defender Detect to post message to it.

* Locate the **Topic** session
* Choose **Select** 
* Choose the Topic **DDD_Alerts** that was previously created during the setup
* Locate the **Role** session
* Choose **Select** 
* Choose the Role containing **DDDtoSNSRole** that was previously created during the setup
* Click **Next** on the bottom right

![CreateSecProf](/images/30_ddd_create_secprof_04.png)

On the next screen, you need to select which devices AWS IoT Device Defender Detect should monitor. For this workshop, you will attach the *Security Profile* to all devices, but in a production environment, you can select the appropriate target depending on the Profile.

* Choose **All things** 
* Click **Next** on the bottom right
* Scroll down and choose **Save**
![CreateSecProf](/images/30_ddd_create_secprof_05.png)
* Choose **Continue** to finish the setup
![CreateSecProf](/images/30_ddd_create_secprof_06.png)

Now, AWS IoT Device Defender is continuosly monitoring the amount of messages sent by each device. Let's check what happens when a thing starts to present an anomalous behavior.

## Understanding the Event

Once configured, AWS IoT Device Defender will monitor your devices and send Alerts to the SNS topic you have configured. SNS will forward the message the Lambda mitigation function adding an envelope with Metadata such as `EventVersion`, `SignatureVersion`, `Timestamp` as showed on the example below.

```json
{
    "Records": [
        {
            "EventSource": "aws:sns",
            "EventVersion": "1.0",
            "EventSubscriptionArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:xxxxxxxxxxxx:DDD_Violations:e17eb501-d98c-4f3c-bb84-c3acd06044e2",
            "Sns": {
                "Type": "Notification",
                "MessageId": "4a368c7b-c98a-5f32-82ba-da33de9e4d57",
                "TopicArn": "arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:xxxxxxxxxxxx:DDD_Violations",
                "Subject": null,
                "Message": "{\"violationEventTime\":1573786800000,\"thingName\":\"dev-IZWB\",\"behavior\":{\"criteria\":{\"consecutiveDatapointsToClear\":1,\"value\":{\"count\":10},\"durationSeconds\":300,\"consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm\":1,\"comparisonOperator\":\"less-than\"},\"name\":\"MessagesPub\",\"metric\":\"aws:num-messages-sent\"},\"violationEventType\":\"in-alarm\",\"metricValue\":{\"count\":54},\"violationId\":\"37e18651d207bbc74236c13faf146127\",\"securityProfileName\":\"MySecProfile\"}",
                "Timestamp": "2019-11-15T03:00:36.527Z",
                "SignatureVersion": "1",
                "Signature": "C+wmlktdLSErFjclDOc4J3LPBLfDUuvIv85NCytpr8pX4Bq/dMnUp6PXCkFIgknG/StekbAJHU0tlKM+aiAXfCKars65i1n+MmZ8Ekkmub70DvO1mCMItnf1TuTxzdljz8g+7fXNaW0qDZypSg3X5ofLPkrxL3r/SMMpAD2FCDD9DVqYk7mAmH6Sz6ygWbNRfKy297jokIjlar//Vu0uL4SmZ3Q2ygQPuq0qEIY7g/DtNdYS1lLhsIVbP0U4lawTck/pg1FmhoVZCG09+UGs9Y1wPM6d9jqLIfiuPXAy2gGncnCaEF66rnIqcX+mkrQSp+tL58cOrCuyybyyxdFmlQ==",
                "SigningCertUrl": "https://sns.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/SimpleNotificationService-6aad65c2f9911b05cd53efda11f913f9.pem",
                "UnsubscribeUrl": "https://sns.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/?Action=Unsubscribe&SubscriptionArn=arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:xxxxxxxxxxxx:DDD_Violations:e17eb501-d98c-4f3c-bb84-c3acd06044e2",
                "MessageAttributes": {}
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

The relevant information is at `['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message']` and you can get it with the following sample code.

This is an example of a `aws:num-messages-sent` message. It contains relevant information you can use to apply a mitigation response, for example, `thingName`, `behavior name` and `metric`.

```json
{
  "violationEventTime": 1573786800000,
  "thingName": "dev-IZWB",
  "behavior": {
    "criteria": {
      "consecutiveDatapointsToClear": 1,
      "value": {
        "count": 10
      },
      "durationSeconds": 300,
      "consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm": 1,
      "comparisonOperator": "less-than"
    },
    "name": "MessagesPub",
    "metric": "aws:num-messages-sent"
  },
  "violationEventType": "in-alarm",
  "metricValue": {
    "count": 54
  },
  "violationId": "37e18651d207bbc74236c13faf146127",
  "securityProfileName": "MySecProfile"
}
```

## Understanding the Mitigation Lambda Function

The Lambda function will extract the name of thing that caused the alarm and add it to the `Quarantine` group (`iot_cli.update_thing_groups_for_thing()`). Using groups, you can easily locate things and apply additional policies restricting the operations they can execute, for example, post message to IoT topics. The function also updates the shadow of the Thing (`iot_data_cli.update_thing_shadow()`) to notify that it was quarantined.

```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    ...
    msg = json.loads(event['Records'][0]['Sns']['Message'])

    thing_name = get_thing_name(msg)

    iot_cli.update_thing_groups_for_thing(
        thingName=thing_name,
        thingGroupsToAdd=[
            IOT_QUARANTINE_GROUP
        ]
    )

    payload = json.dumps({'state': { 'desired': { 'quarantine': True } }})

    iot_data_cli.update_thing_shadow(
        thingName=thing_name,
        payload=payload
    )

    return "OK"
```

## Understanding the Function Permissions and Role

The lambda function needs permission to add things to thing group (`iot:AddThingToThingGroup`) and update the shadow (`iot:UpdateThingShadow`).

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iot:AddThingToThingGroup",
                "iot:UpdateThingGroupsForThing",
                "iot:UpdateThingShadow"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:iot:*:*:*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Configuring the AWS Lambda Function Trigger

You have configured AWS IoT Device Defender Detect to send events to SNS. Now, you need to trigger the lambda function, when events arrive on SNS.

1. Open AWS Lambda console
1. Choose the `Alerts` Lambda Function
1. Choose **+ Add trigger**
1. For **Trigger** type `SNS`
1. Choose SNS
1. Locate the Topic with `DDA_Alerts`
1. Check if the trigger is enabled
1. Choose **Add**

You have finished the configuration of the solution. Now it is time to test it!

## Starting a Virtual Device

Your account has a virtual device factory that creates devices on demand. To create a new device, follow the step below:

1. Open the Cloud9 Environment you created during the preparation
1. Go to the root directory of the repository

```bash
cd ~/environment/aws-iot-playground
```

1. Run the the following command to start a virtual device

```bash
./scripts/cp-create-thing.sh generic
```

This will start a virtual device that sends 30 messages every 5 minutes. After a 5 minutes, Device Defender should identify this anomalous behavior and send 
an Alert.

## Monitoring Violations

If you want to follow the Violations detected by AWS IoT Device Defender Detect, you can follow the steps below.

<details><summary>**Using AWS CLI in Cloud9**</summary>
<p>

```bash
aws iot list-active-violations
```

Output example:

```bash
aws iot list-active-violations
{
    "activeViolations": [
        {
            "violationId": "74de151f21724d91b89bcb87c1fa2c88",
            "thingName": "dev-XBHY",
            "securityProfileName": "MsgSentSecProfile",
            "behavior": {
                "name": "MsgSentBehavior",
                "metric": "aws:num-messages-sent",
                "criteria": {
                    "comparisonOperator": "less-than",
                    "value": {
                        "count": 10
                    },
                    "durationSeconds": 300,
                    "consecutiveDatapointsToAlarm": 1,
                    "consecutiveDatapointsToClear": 1
                }
            },
            "lastViolationValue": {
                "count": 27
            },
            "lastViolationTime": 1574254500.0,
            "violationStartTime": 1574254500.0
        }
    ]
}
```
</p>
</details>

## Checking 

The Alert will trigger the lambda function that will move the virtual device to the `Quarantine` *Thing Group*. You can check if it worked following the steps.

1. Open the AWS IoT console
1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Defend**
1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Detect**


<details><summary>**Using AWS CLI in Cloud9**</summary>
<p>

To check the thing groups for a specific device
```bash
$ aws iot list-thing-groups-for-thing \
    --thing-name <thing-name>
```

Sample output:

```bash
$ aws iot list-thing-groups-for-thing \
    --thing-name dev-XBHY
{
    "thingGroups": [
        {
            "groupName": "Quarantine",
            "groupArn": "arn:aws:iot:us-east-1:883951760139:thinggroup/Quarantine"
        }
    ]
}
```
To check the shadow for a specific devic.

```bash
$ aws iot-data get-thing-shadow \
    --thing-name <device-name> \
    /tmp/shadow_output

$ jq . /tmp/shadow_output
```

sample output:

```bash
$ aws iot-data get-thing-shadow \
    --thing-name dev-XBHY \
    /tmp/shadow_output

$ jq . /tmp/shadow_output
{
  "state": {
    "desired": {
      "debug": "off",
      "quarantine": true
    },
    "delta": {
      "debug": "off",
      "quarantine": true
    }
  },
  "metadata": {
    "desired": {
      "debug": {
        "timestamp": 1574251760
      },
      "quarantine": {
        "timestamp": 1574254539
      }
    }
  },
  "version": 2,
  "timestamp": 1574256114
}
```
